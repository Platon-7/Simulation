Notes

1- If you want to perform your own tests, in case you change the value of the initial_point make sure to input a decimal point because
for some reason Python recognizes it as a discrete value and it doesn't work.

2- The ESS is calculated by the use of Tensorflow which is heavy so I marked the code as comment so that you don't have to install it.
In case you want to run it, remove the '#' and install Tensorflow and Tensorflow_Probability.

3- The matrix with the results is not dynamic for simplicity.

4- It is highly recommended to use the Jupyter Notebook Format file because it is more appropriate in this case.
